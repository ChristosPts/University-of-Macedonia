# Digital Design - Modeling of Logic Circuits

## Instructions
Create the following circuits in VHDL using as many models/methods as you can (DataFlow,Behavioral/Algorithmic,Structural)
1) Even Parity Generator
2) 8 to 3 Encoder
3) 1 to 8 Demultiplexer
4) 4bit Counter
5) 4 bit Subtracter

In your implementations, present the simulation results.
