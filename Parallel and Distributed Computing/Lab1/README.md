## Introduction to threads
Study and build on the codes from HelloJavaThreads.

1. Write code that creates two threads, but each belongs to a different class.
For example a class can have a different constructor or a different run() method.
You can if you want to use inheritance and polymorphism.

2. Extend the code in question 1 to create multiple threads from each class.

3. Modify the code in question 2 using (a) inner and (b) anonymous classes
